# Installation instructions
Installation guide for Activel gel vertex model of spherical domes
This document explains how to install and set up the vertex model application on your system.


## Installing hiperlife
Prior to following the instructions for installing the vertex model application, it is necessary to download the hiperlife library [[1](#References)] at {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14927572} and follow the INSTALL.md instructions there in. Note that installing the hiperlife library and it's dependencies can take over an hour.

For completeness, we summarize the necessary steps here.

### Downloading and installing hiperlife and its dependencies

**General dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ gfortran cmake libopenmpi-dev libboost-filesystem-dev liblapack-dev libscalapack-openmpi-dev
```

**Required by Scotch**
```bash
sudo apt-get install flex bison yacc
```

**Required by VTK**
```bash
sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopengl-dev libglx-dev
```
By default, all of these dependencies are downloaded, compiled and installed directly by the hiperlife's build system.
Once the library has been downloaded, create a build folder in the top directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
then execute cmake to generate the build system files (MakeFile, etc.)

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/install/hiperlife>
```
where <path/to/install/hiperlife> is where the library will be installed, e.g., in a new folder ~/.local/hiperlife.

Then compile with :

```bash
make -jX dependencies
```
where *X* is the number of cores (e.g. *8*).
Once all the dependencies are ready, hiperlife can be compiled and installed :
```bash
cmake ..
make -jX install
```


## Installing agvm_domes

We followed the instruction given [here](https://gitlab.com/hiperlife/hl-base-project) for creating a hiperlife-base project. 

This project uses **CMake** with multiple `CMakeLists.txt` files:
- `CMakeLists.txt` (root) → sets up the project and adds subdirectories.
- `src/CMakeLists.txt` → builds the core library (`aux`) and the main program.

Once the code has been downloaded, create a build folder in the top directory :
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
Then configure the project :

```bash
cmake -DHL_BASE_PATH=<path/to/install/hiperlife>  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/install/app> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
```
where <path/to/install/hiperlife> is the path where the library has been installed (e.g. ~/.local/hiperlife) and <path/to/install/app> is the path where the application executable will be installed (e.g. in a new folder ~/.local/agvm_domes). Note that the name of the executable is *hlVXDomes*.

## Installation remarks

The installation was done with the following setup :
- Dell Intel® Xeon(R) Silver 4208 CPU @ 2.10GHz × 32
- 62.5 GiB memory 
- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- hiperlife-release-5.0.0-beta (also available [here](https://gitlab.com/hiperlife/hiperlife/-/tree/release-5.0.0-beta?ref_type=tags))

When installing hiperlife and the dependencies, here a few ad-hoc modifications that might be necessary :
1) Remember to tell your OS the location of the installed libraries. For UNIX systems you can add the paths of these libraries to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. To avoid adding the paths to each terminal session, you can put these instructions in the ~/.bashrc file. As an example, the following code is an extract of the ~/.bashrc file in which we are appending the paths to the openmpi and hiperlife libraries and then exporting the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


```bash
# Paths to libraries
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/hiperlifelib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/hiperlife:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Same for the path to the agvm_domes executable
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/agvm_domes/:$PATH"

```


Then the ~/.bashrc file needs to be sourced again
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


2) "sudo apt-get install flex bison" instead of "sudo apt-get install flex bison yacc"
3) Make sure to have an updated g++ compiler. Check your compiler version with 
```bash
g++ --version
```
4) If <path/to/install/hiperlife> was set to ~/.local/hiperlife, in ~/.local/hiperlife/lib/cmake/hiperlife/hiperlifeConfig.cmake:42 use
```bash
    set_and_check(hiperlife_MPI_DIR /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi)
```
instead of 
```bash
set_and_check(hiperlife_MPI_DIR /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/openmpi)
```
